I adapted from the following code:
https://ohm.bu.edu/~cdubois/CLEAN/pings%20and%20things/

In a linux environment, copy the pinger.c file to somewhere.

Run the following command to build.
gcc pinger.c -o pinger

Try to run the program like this without sudo: 
./pinger google.com

If it complains, you can try to run it with sudo like this:
sudo ./pinger google.com
